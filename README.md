# Overcomplicated-TicTacToe
Rust tic tac toe that i decided to overcomplicate bc I thought it was funny :B \
Yes, I know this sucks :V 

First, install rust => https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install \
Then you can run `git clone` or `git checkout` or just download the zip file \
To try out the code, cd to the folder and run `cargo run --example basic` in terminal
