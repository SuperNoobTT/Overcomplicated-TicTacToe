# Overcomplicated-TicTacToe
Rust tic tac toe that i decided to overcomplicate bc I thought it was funny :B \
Yes, I know this sucks :V 

First, install rust => https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install \
Then you can run `git clone "https://github.com/SuperNoobTT/Overcomplicated-TicTacToe.git"` in your terminal\
or just download the zip file and extract it 🐥

To try out the code, cd to the folder and run `cargo run --example basic` in terminal 🍇
